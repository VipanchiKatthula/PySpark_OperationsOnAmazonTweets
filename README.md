# PySpark Operations On Amazon Tweets
This repository shows the implementation of Spark context, Spark SQL context on Amazon Tweets data set with 400k Tweets. I dealt with tweet_id (id_str), Tweet_created_time, Retweet_count, Favourite_count to find the days with high influx of tweets. 
Analyzed the tweets on the busiest day to find the words that were repeated the most in the selected tweets.
